# Mercury

Mercury is a web app that uses the Oxford Dictionaries API to translate words to English. You enter a word in your language, and are shown a list of their English counterparts and how to pronounce them, together with examples to show how to use the words in English sentences.

> Disclaimer: This app is neither developed nor endorsed by Oxford Dictionaries. The code is available as-is, on an MIT license.

A customised version of the app, which translates Urdu words to English, is at [Tarjuma](https://tarjuma.herokuapp.com). 

Customisation instructions are in the Mercury documentation, which also contains a [demo](https://aninditabasu.github.io/mercury/index.html).

# How to use Mercury

The app runs on Python, but you don't need to know Python to use (or install) the app.

### Prerequisites

You need an API key from [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/). The free plan is adequate for testing purposes but, for translations, you need a paid plan.

### Steps

**TL;DR:** Clone this repo, edit the values in the `config.json` file, and run it on Python. You need Python 3.7 and the Flask library.

**Detailed instructions:** See the [Mercury documentation](https://aninditabasu.github.io/mercury/index.html).
