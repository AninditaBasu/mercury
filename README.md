# Mercury

Mercury is a web app that uses the Oxford Dictionaries API to translate words to English. You enter a word in your language, and are shown a list of their English counterparts and how to pronounce them, together with examples to show how to use the words in English sentences.

# How to use Mercury

The app runs on Python, but you don't need to know Python to use the app.

**Prerequisite**

API keys from Oxford Dictionaries

**Steps**

TL;DR: Clone this repo, edit the values in the `config.json` file, and run it on Python. You need Python 3.7 and the Flask library.
